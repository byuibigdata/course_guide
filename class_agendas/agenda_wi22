## Week 5

### Day 13: Pyspark deep dive

### Day 14: Teams work on features

- Start pseudo team report for features 

### Day 15: Teams feature presentation 

- Team pull request into feature challenge submitted. 
- Teams present their features to the class (each team will get 5 minutes to justify their features)
- Hathaway approves features and provides short training on PySpark based on student questions.

## Week 6

### Day 16: Pyspark training continues and/or individual coding time for feature development

### Day 17: Pyspark team training development.

### Day 18: Teams present function training.

## Week 7

### Day 19: Open programming data for feature development

### Day 20:  In-class discussion about target variable, training, and validating model

- What can we predict that will be most representable for a client that wants to open a fast-casual restaurant?
- What spatial region provides the best granularity without overwhelming the process or introducing too much overfit?
- How are we going to handle time in our modeling?
- What will we have to do so that our targets don’t leach into our features?

### Day 21: Teams present their features, and the class finalizes plans for key features (10 minutes per team)

## Week 8

### Day 22:  Feature merging and refining for the class dataset.

- Finalize features and merge them into the class dataset

### Day 23: Round 2 of feature presentations

- Clean and clear visuals about how your feature relates to the target values.
Clean diagram or pseudocode description that proves your feature is calculated correctly to everyone.
- Succinct table/visual that helps us see how your feature varies spatially and categorically (NAICS) within our problem.

### Day 24: In-class coding challenge using PySpark or SparkSQL

## Week 9

### Day 25:  Planning the rest of the semester

Each team will be responsible for putting together a pitch for the learning topics to complete during the remainder of the semester. You get five minutes for your pitch.

1. Explain why your pick should be ranked number 1.
2. Explain why the others should be ranked farther down than 1.

I want each team to put together a class period’s worth of material on the topic.

- Docker?
- Streamlight?
- Machine learning?
- Model explainers?
- Spark optimization?
