## Writing a grade request letter

### Background

Writing a grade request letter is a skill. This experience mimics an end-of-year review with your employer.  A good employer will clearly explain their expectations for the year.  Often, you can be expected to justify your work and explain how you delivered on those expectations. Here are some general rules.

1. __Working hard is shown by your products, not your hours.__ Be clear on what you delivered.
2. __Hours matter. Time is what lets you produce. Finish your work and learn to create more work__ When you commit to working for your employer, you work. Don't let distractions stop you from delivering.
3. __Seek clarity.__ Take the time to understand the expectations.  Communicate often and clearly.

#### Grade Request Guidelines for student

The syllabus provides more details. However, here are the requirements for the grade of A that he is requesting.

- Hours: 110
- Challenges: A satisfactory score (3) on all the challenges and at least a near-perfect score (3.8) on the key challenges. All challenges must be completed.
- Replication: All replication assignments are completed with full credit.
- Involvement: Two or fewer conversations from me or the TA about your lack of participation or preparedness. Missing class less than three times.
- Impact: Multiple projects where you were recognized as a primary contributor (making more impact than half of your team). All projects include your fingerprints.

### Example of poorly worded request

#### The first letter

Dear Brother Hathaway,

I’m writing to turn in my grade-request letter. Over the course of the semester, I feel I have met all of the standards for an A grade in the syllabus.
I personally liked the fact that we had real-world problems to solve using big data and that we had to work like collectives solving issues, giving me a very good insight in a possible real-world attempt to achieve these desired results, with a very useful experience that I haven’t had before coming to this class. I liked the fact that you had options for the subject; you let us choose a specific project during a period of time, and for me, having this project to complete was a personalized way to study and learn something specific that I liked and is related to a field I’m working on. I liked how we used industry tools such as Polars library, Pyspark, and Spark SQL through Docker and Databricks to achieve data science real world techniques, which is quite a common technology used on the field of big data. And, lastly, the fact that you placed some communication work as part of the curriculum, and I’m saying this because I know already even before this class, that communication is key and it is a big issue with us, you allowed us to work on teams and, as I said before, I already felt it was a problem for me personally both on communicating and working as a team player, and I sincerely felt you gave me the chance to improve in this subject.

Furthermore, I spent not less than 110 hours in this class both in-class and outside class hours. I scored 3 on all coding challenges. This proves that I was able to do data munging, visualization, as well as feature creation using tools such as Polars, Pyspark, and SparkSQL. In some key challenges that I worked really hard on; I did score 100 percent.

Last but not the least, I have done all scheduled replications projects and scored 3 and above on all of them. As far as for the class session goes, I create participation by joining in class discussion, team meetings and task delegations and decision-making sessions. I was there physically for every workday. I participated in multiple projects where I was given the highest contribution. I respectfully request for an A grade. The reason I write this is because I have gained knowledge in big data, and I am declared proficient in its analytics.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Previous Semester Student

##### My commentary

> Over the course of the semester, I feel I have met all of the standards for an A grade in the syllabus.

- Be careful with words like "feel" in a letter based on facts. This could be looked over if clear facts are presented latter.

> Furthermore, I spent not less than 110 hours in this class both in-class and outside class hours. I scored 3 on all coding challenges. This proves that I was able to do data munging, visualization, as well as feature creation using tools such as Polars, Pyspark, and SparkSQL.

- Notice how this student lists a bunch of facts but does not connect them to the requirements. Also, he does not talk about which challenges earned a 4 (the highest score).

> In some key challenges that I worked really hard on; I did score 100 percent.

- "Working really hard" does not earn a grade. Additionally, this sentence is vague and does not speak to which challenges garnered this "100 percent"

> Last but not the least, I have done all scheduled replications projects and scored 3 and above on all of them. As far as for the class session goes, I create participation by joining in class discussion, team meetings and task delegations and decision-making sessions. I was there physically for every workday.

- This student says, "I was there physically for every workday" but was not.

>  I participated in multiple projects where I was given the highest contribution. I respectfully request for an A grade.

- Feel free to request any grade you desire.  However, make sure it is connected to the requirements for an A.

#### My short response in Canvas

You have a 2.5 on the first pyspark challenge. That would put you less than a B. You also missed at least three days of class. I will do a B+.

#### Student's email response

Hello Brother Hathaway, 

I saw the grade you gave and made mention of the pyspark challenge. You said we could redo it and you sent me a message to redo it for a grade greater than that. I resubmitted the challenge and I have not seen this grade it, for the attendance I missed two classes, the other one you said students were going to Provo for a career fair. I really appreciate all your efforts and I will love if you kindly regrade my challenge and please give me an A because I feel like I have really worked so hard. Thank you so much for considering. 

#### My response (edited)

Here is the detail. Please carefully read the syllabus and what I have said. I need a well worded response to each to understand what we can do to move forward.

- You have a 2.5 on the Pyspark Groupby and Join challenge. I see no resubmission, and it was offered to you in the comments. __Redo this first spark challenge to all correct answers and work.__
- Your deployment app did not get a 4. You got a 3. __Redo this to all the specifications listed to earn a 4.__
- You said, “I was there physically for every workday.” in your cover letter, which is now not what you are saying in this email. When you were gone, you did not communicate about your missing class. __Please rewrite your cover letter with details that are correct and state how you did or did not meet each of the requirements for the grade you are requesting.__
- An A says getting 4 on the “key” challenges which was discussed as the two pyspark challenges and the app challenge. You have a 2.5, 3.8, and 3. 
- Finally, your email and cover letter reference “working really hard,” which was never part of what should be stated in the letter. You state your hours and let your challenges speak to the work. I am a bit concerned at the tone of the email without any effort on your part to read the syllabus and make the argument from the specifications listed there.

I admire your effort. Frankly, your challenges don’t qualify you for a B+. If you would like me to change the grade to an A, then you must do what is said in the bold sentences.

Please respond as to how you would like to move forward.

Thanks,

J.
